# ParkPal Opportunity Index 🚗📊

## Overview

Urban drivers spend **dozens of hours per year** circling for parking. This wasted time increases traffic congestion, emissions, and frustration.  
**ParkPal Opportunity Index (POI)** is an algorithmic framework that combines **geospatial analysis** and **time series modeling** to identify the most promising parking zones at any given time.

This repo is both:

- A **research-driven prototype** for testing algorithms in parking demand forecasting.
- A **portfolio project** showcasing applied skills in **Python, geospatial analytics, optimization, and time-series forecasting**.

---

## Key Features

- 🗺️ **Geospatial Analysis** → Leverages GIS data (road networks, parking zones, points of interest).
- ⏱️ **Time-Series Forecasting** → Models demand trends across different hours/days.
- ⚖️ **Weighted Opportunity Index** → Assigns scores to each location based on multiple factors (proximity, demand, availability).
- 📈 **Optimization-Oriented** → Provides a baseline framework for smarter parking allocation.

---

## Problem Statement

Drivers often struggle with inefficient parking due to:

- Lack of real-time availability data.
- High variability in demand depending on time of day.
- Poor integration of **traffic flow** and **urban design factors**.

**Goal:** Develop a reproducible framework that ranks parking opportunities across a city, combining geospatial and temporal data into a unified **opportunity score**.

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition**

   - Public geospatial data (road networks, parking zone shapefiles).
   - Time-series demand data (parking meter usage, mobility patterns).

2. **Preprocessing**

   - Clean + merge spatial + temporal datasets.
   - Convert shapefiles to GeoDataFrames with `geopandas`.

3. **Scoring Function (Opportunity Index)**

   - Input factors (weights adjustable by the user):
     - 🅿️ Availability (supply of parking spots).
     - 🚦 Demand (historical occupancy, traffic flow).
     - 📍 Proximity (to POIs like offices, stadiums, shopping centers).
     - 🕒 Time sensitivity (rush hours vs. off-peak).
   - Output: **Opportunity Index (0–100)** per zone.

4. **Visualization**
   - Interactive heatmaps of scores across a city grid.
   - Time-series plots showing demand fluctuations.

## Example Use Case

Imagine downtown San Francisco:

- A driver opens a **ParkPal-powered app** at 6 PM.
- The algorithm computes the **opportunity index** across nearby zones.
- The app suggests Zone A (higher probability of quick availability, lower walking distance to destination).
- The driver parks in minutes instead of circling the block.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: `pandas`, `geopandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `folium`
- **Geospatial**: `shapely`, `osmnx` (OpenStreetMap data)
- **Time-Series**: `statsmodels`, `prophet` (or `scikit-learn` regressors)

---

## Future Directions

- ✅ Prototype scoring function.
- 🔄 Incorporate ML-based forecasting for dynamic demand.
- 📡 Integrate with **real-time IoT data** (sensors, APIs).
- 🚀 Extend into a full **ParkPal optimization engine**.
